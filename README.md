# API project for Web Technologies course.

# 3 REST APIs for an E-commerce shop, suppliers and a bank. 


## Clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/divan19/web-project-ecommerce.git
```

This project has 3 APIs. 
- ecommerce-api
- bank-api
- suppliers-api

3 different `node` servers need to be run simultaneously for these 3 APIs.

## To install the requirements for this project, go into the 3 directories for 3 different APIs and run:
```
npm install
```

## To start the servers, go into the 3 directories and run:
```
nodemon index.js
```

We will need (Postman)[https://www.postman.com/downloads] software to test and demonstrate the APIs. 

Following is a list of the API endpoints:
